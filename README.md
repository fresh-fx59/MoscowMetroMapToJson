This JAVA code 

1. pulls data from URL
2. converts it to JSON
3. writes data to JSON file
4. reads data from JSON file
5. outputs stations count on each line and counts interconnections

I've used Maven and Java 11.
This code works with wayback machine snapshot. In current version of site https://www.moscowmap.ru/metro.html#lines there is no interconnections. Supported page version is attached.
